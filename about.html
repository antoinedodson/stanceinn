                    Established in 2014, Stance Innovators started off with a group of friends who loved the same thing - cars. 
                    More than just a team, StanceInn as a brand has now evolved to something much greater than we could have imagined. 
                    With now over 60 members, StanceInn is becoming what we have dreamed of since the beginning, and thatâ€™s all thanks 
                    to the support we receive from you |>
